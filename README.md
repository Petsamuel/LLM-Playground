# LLM Playground

Welcome to the LLM Playground repository! This collection is dedicated to showcasing the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Google Colab notebooks. Explore a range of projects related to LLMs, including but not limited to those utilizing langchain and similar technologies.

## About LangChain

LangChain is a tool for developers that enables the creation of chains using large language models (LLMs). These chains can generate text based on provided prompts. LangChain offers versatility in constructing different types of chains and can be integrated with existing LangChain constructs. Each step in the chain requires specific prompts, and input data must be formatted appropriately for optimal outputs. LangChain is also useful for feeding large documents into LLMs.

For more detailed information, refer to the [LangChain documentation](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/).
